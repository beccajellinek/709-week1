# Reflection Log

1. What are the top things you learned from these out-of-class readings, videos, and exercises?
   - token is any element in the program, like an operand or a variable
   - high-level languages are portable, which means the language can be run on any computer. 
3. What information surprised you? What might you share with others or your current/future students?
   - The Scanner Bug (reading an `int` followed by a `String`)
5. What might you consider implementing in your own classroom?
   - Encouraging breaking down the problem into small parts, and testing those parts (running the program, printing internal state) before adding additional complexity to the program
   - the basic instructions of programming (input, output, math, decision, repetition)
   - memory diagrams for variable assignment and how state may change over time
   - reading and understanding error messages such that we can fix our programs
   - practice commiting after each exercise, do one final push at the end
7. What do you need to explore more? What the knowledge and skills that you may need to return to in the future to strengthen?
   - floating point numbers and rounding errors
